## Mindsets

**Mindset** is a *self theory*. It sounds ~~very~~ meta, i.e. self-referential, but I think it's important to take stock of yourself to honestly grow. If you arn't aware of how you're thinking, growth can still happen, but it will be harder to track and make adjustments. 

There are two main mindsets to consider:
 
###### Fixed mindset

It's sort of self explanitory for the pure fact of being fixed. Fundamentally a nature above nurture approach. Your intelligence, ability, and growth capacity is viewed as fixed. This person sees themselves as stuck in place! Or, they view their learning trajectory as linear, not exponential or ever increasing.  

# **_Growth mindset_** 

Brains and talent are ***just the starting point***. Growth can and will come through sacrifice, focus, helpful criticism. Being smart is not something you are or arn't. You can get smarter! Constant and neverending improvement comes to mind, which someone once called CAN-I. 

Final thoughts/reminders:
> ***"Try harder!  "***

***Trying harder is growing.***

***Fixed is foolish.***
