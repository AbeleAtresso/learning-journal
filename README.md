## Mindsets

**Mindset** is a *self theory*. It sounds ~very~ meta but I think it's important to take stock of yourself to honestly grow. 

There are two main mindsets to consider:
 
###### Fixed mindset

It's sort of self explainitory for the pure fact of being fixed. Fundamentally a nature above nurture approach. Your intelligence, ability, and growth capacity is viewed as fixed. This person sees themselves as stuck in place! 

# **_Growth mindset_** 

Brains and talent are ***just the starting point***. Growth can and will come through sacrifice, focus, helpful criticism
Being smart is not something you are or arn't. You can get smarter!

Final thoughts/reminders: ***"Try harder!  "***
***Trying harder is growing.***
***Fixed is foolish.***
