## Types of text editors:

> Third Party Options <br>(these don't come with standard the standard operating systems) 
+ Atom (Made by GitHub)
+ Brackets ("Live Preview" feature automatically updates website)
+ Notepad ++ (Windows only)
+ Text Wrangler (Mac only)
+ BB Edit (free for 30 days) 
+ VS Code (widely used, many tools and extension packages available. I personally like the preview pane)
+ Sublime (free and paid premium version. Has code completion which saves a lot of time)

> IDEs: Integrated Development Environments <br>
(A whole suite of software than integrates more aspects of software/web dev than a simple text-editor, supporting multiple languages, debugging, etc.)

+ Visual Studio (Microsoft's IDE, works on the three major OSs)
+ X Code (mac)
+ Eclipse
+ PyCharm

It's important to be considerate about what text-editor/IDE you use because they each have their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of design, features, and support. 

A lot also depends on your personal preference. 

Because you will spend a lot of time coding any major project, choosing editors you like will make the process more enjoyable and smoother.

If just starting out, a simpler editor might be for you so as not to overwhelm you. Then you can step up to more complex and comprehensive editors and your needs and breadth of understanding increase.
