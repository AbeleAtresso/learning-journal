## Types of text editors:

> Third Party Options <br>(these don't come with standard the standard operating systems) 
+ Atom (Made by GitHub)
+ Brackets ("Live Preview" feature automatically updates website)
+ Notepad ++ (Windows only)
+ Text Wrangler (Mac only)
+ BB Edit (free for 30 days) 
+ VS Code (widely used, many tools and extension packages available. I personally like the preview pane)
+ Sublime (free and paid premium version. Has code completion which saves a lot of time)

> IDEs: Integrated Development Environments <br>
(A whole suite of software than integrates more aspects of software/web dev than a simple text-editor, supporting multiple languages, debugging, etc.)

+ Visual Studio (Microsoft's IDE, works on the three major OSs)
+ X Code (mac)
+ Eclipse
+ PyCharm

It's important to be considerate about what text-editor/IDE you use because they each have their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of design, features, and support. 

A lot also depends on your personal preference. 

Because you will spend a lot of time coding any major project, choosing editors you like will make the process more enjoyable and smoother.

If just starting out, a simpler editor might be for you so as not to overwhelm you. Then you can step up to more complex and comprehensive editors a×“ your needs and breadth of understanding increase.

coders_computer.md  LICENSE               README.md    tryinghard.jpg
`

## Bonus: how to get into the Windows C drive using WSL: 

> `~$ cd /mnt/c/Users/jacob
jacob$ cd /mnt/c/Users/jacob/OneDrive/`

`mnt` = mount
