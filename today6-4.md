Today I learned how to clone my GitGub repo into a local folder, use Visual Studio code with Git Bash, set up my Git Bash configuration profile, and push/add my edited repo/file back to the master branch using Git commands. 

I also learned how to add new files on VSC as well as set up instant commits in VSC. 

Also used `git status` command to check what has been added to the master repo after editing files. Remember to save in VSC! 

Note to self: these commits only commit locally. Don't forget to add the edited files back to the master branch using git commands.
