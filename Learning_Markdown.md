## Markdown is easy to learn. 

What's it all about?

Simple: 
It's just typing a few simple characters like # or * before and/or after the text. Then bam! Those characters are interpreted as changes in font, headings, and more!

Say you want to check items off a list. On a new line enter a dash, then a space, then a left-side bracket (it's next to the p key). Then enter a lower case x and a right-side bracket (hopefully you've found that by now). 

It should look like this:

[x]

Then hit space and name your list item. Hit return and repeat the process. Remember, no x if it's not done! 

- [x] Learn what brackets are.
- [ ] Watch the Brak show.
